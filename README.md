# Google-Concept
My take on the revamp Google.com homepage with a mega menu. Using just html5 and CSS3 for things like the jumbo menu, font awesome icons, removal of the Search and I'm Feeling Lucky buttons and replaced them with icons with tooltips. Also icons were added in place for Gmail and others with removed text links except on footer.
